Inspired by Scandinavian design principles, NORDIKA embodies our belief that great design should be accessible to everyone. Clean lines meet honest materials. Form follows function. Every detail serves a purpose.

**Build Your Perfect Storage Solution**

The modular design means you're not limited to a standard shelf. Start with a single unit or create a floor-to-ceiling library. Add modules horizontally or vertically. Mix open shelves with closed cabinets. The NORDIKA system grows with you.

        question: 'How difficult is assembly? Can I do it alone?',
        answer: 'NORDIKA is designed for easy solo assembly! We\'ve tested it with hundreds of customers, and the average assembly time is just 30 minutes. Components are color-coded, steps are numbered clearly, and all tools are included. If you can build IKEA furniture, you can definitely build NORDIKA. We also offer video tutorials and live chat support if you need help.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this bookshelf strong enough for heavy books?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! Each shelf supports up to 25kg‚Äîthat\'s roughly 50-80 average hardcover books per shelf. The engineered wood core and oak veneer construction create an incredibly strong structure. We\'ve tested it extensively to exceed safety standards. For maximum stability, we include wall anchors which we strongly recommend using, especially if you have children.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How sustainable is this product really?',
        answer: 'Sustainability is core to our design. The oak veneer comes from FSC-certified forests (independently verified sustainable forestry). The core contains 70% recycled wood fibers. Finishes are water-based with zero VOC emissions. Flat-pack design reduces shipping emissions by 50% compared to pre-assembled furniture. Packaging is 100% recyclable. At end of life, the entire bookshelf can be recycled. Plus, we offset 100% of shipping carbon emissions.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I expand this system later or connect multiple units?',
        answer: 'Yes! That\'s the beauty of the modular design. You can purchase additional NORDIKA units and connect them side-by-side using the included connector hardware. Or stack them vertically (with proper wall anchoring). Mix different heights and widths. The system is designed to grow with your needs. Many customers start with one unit and expand over time.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What if it doesn\'t fit my space or I change my mind?',
        answer: 'You have 365 days‚Äîa full year‚Äîto return it for any reason. Changed your mind? No problem. Found different furniture? That\'s fine. Even if you\'ve assembled it and used it for 6 months, you can still return it for a full refund. We believe you should love your furniture, and we don\'t want you stuck with something that doesn\'t work for you.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Will this look cheap or like budget furniture?',
        answer: 'Not at all! The oak veneer finish is genuine wood, giving it a premium look and feel. Many customers tell us it looks much more expensive than it is. We use quality materials and careful craftsmanship‚Äîwe just eliminate unnecessary markup by selling direct and using efficient flat-pack shipping. Compare it to furniture costing 2-3x more, and you\'ll see the quality difference is minimal.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you offer assembly and delivery services?',
        answer: 'Yes! While the bookshelf is designed for easy DIY assembly, we offer professional assembly service for ‚Ç¨49. Our trained assemblers will bring their own tools, assemble the unit in your chosen room, and remove all packaging. We also offer "home delivery" service (‚Ç¨39) where we deliver to your apartment/room instead of just curbside. These services can be added during checkout.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I clean and maintain oak veneer furniture?',
        answer: 'It\'s very easy! For regular cleaning, just dust with a soft, dry cloth. For deeper cleaning, use a slightly damp (not wet) cloth with mild soap, then dry immediately. Avoid harsh chemicals and abrasive cleaners. The water-based finish is durable and stain-resistant. With normal care, your NORDIKA will look beautiful for decades. We include a detailed care guide with every purchase.',
