      shortDescription: 'Exquisite 18K white gold solitaire featuring a meticulously selected GIA-certified 0.50ct diamond, handcrafted by master jewelers with over 150 hours of meticulous attention.',
      fullDescription: `**The Eternal Radiance: Where Art Meets Emotion**

Some moments transcend time. A promise of forever. A declaration of love. A celebration of commitment. The Eternal Radiance Diamond Solitaire Ring is more than jewelry—it's a symbol of your unique love story, destined to become a cherished heirloom for generations.

**A Diamond Beyond Compare**
At the heart of this masterpiece lies a carefully selected 0.50-carat round brilliant diamond, certified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). Our diamond specialists personally evaluate over 100 stones to select each diamond in our collection, choosing only those that exhibit exceptional beauty, brilliance, and character.

**The 4Cs of Perfection:**
- **Cut**: Excellent (Triple Excellent) — Optimized for maximum brilliance, fire, and scintillation
- **Color**: G (Near Colorless) — The sweet spot of exceptional value and breathtaking beauty
- **Clarity**: VS1 (Very Slightly Included) — Eye-clean with microscopic characteristics invisible to the naked eye
- **Carat**: 0.50ct — The perfect balance of presence and elegance

**Craftsmanship Refined Over Centuries**
Each Eternal Radiance ring is handcrafted in our European atelier by master jewelers with decades of experience. The process begins with ethically sourced 18K white gold (75% pure gold), meticulously refined and alloyed for optimal strength, durability, and luminosity.

The signature six-prong setting is designed to maximize light performance while providing superior security for your precious diamond. Each prong is individually shaped, positioned, and polished to perfection. The cathedral-style shoulders elevate the center stone, creating an illusion of the diamond floating in light.

The delicate pavé band features 18 meticulously set accent diamonds (0.16ct total), each hand-selected for uniform brilliance. Our micropavé technique creates a seamless river of light that enhances without overpowering.

**Precious Details:**
- **18K White Gold**: 75% pure gold (hallmarked 750), rhodium-plated for enduring brilliance
- **Comfort Fit Interior**: Gently rounded interior ensures all-day comfort
- **Handcrafted Excellence**: 150+ hours of meticulous craftsmanship
- **Weight**: 3.8 grams of precious metal

        question: 'Is this diamond genuinely certified by GIA?',
        answer: 'Yes, absolutely. Every Eternal Radiance ring features a center diamond certified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), the world\'s most respected diamond grading authority. Your ring includes the original GIA Diamond Grading Report with a unique serial number that can be verified online at GIA.edu. Many of our diamonds also feature an optional laser inscription on the girdle (visible only under 10x magnification) matching the GIA report number.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I customize or modify this ring design?',
        answer: 'Absolutely! While the Eternal Radiance design is perfect as-is, we offer extensive customization: choose from 14K or 18K white, yellow, or rose gold; select a different center diamond size (from 0.30ct to 2.00ct); modify the setting style (4-prong, 6-prong, bezel); add or remove pavé diamonds; create matching wedding bands. Our design consultants will work with you to create your dream ring while maintaining the signature Eternal Radiance aesthetic. Custom pieces typically require 3-4 weeks.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What is your return and exchange policy for engagement rings?',
        answer: 'We want you to be absolutely certain. You have 30 days from delivery to return or exchange your ring for any reason—no questions asked. The ring must be unworn, unaltered, and in its original condition with all packaging and documentation. We provide a prepaid, fully insured return label. Your refund is processed within 5 business days of receiving the return. If you need a different ring size, exchanges are complimentary within 60 days.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I know this diamond is ethically sourced and conflict-free?',
        answer: 'Ethical sourcing is non-negotiable for us. Every diamond in our collection is 100% conflict-free and Kimberley Process certified. We maintain complete supply chain transparency—we can trace each diamond from the specific mine to your finger. We partner exclusively with suppliers who share our commitment to fair labor practices, environmental responsibility, and community development. Additionally, we provide a System of Warranties statement with every purchase, guaranteeing the ethical provenance of your diamond.',

        question: 'Are payment plans available for luxury jewelry?',
        answer: 'Yes! We offer flexible financing through our premium partners. Qualified customers can choose 0% APR for 12 months, or extended terms up to 36 months with competitive rates. The application is simple, secure, and provides instant approval in most cases. There\'s no impact on your credit score to check your eligibility.

If you\'re proposing as a surprise, many customers borrow an existing ring or consult a friend/family member. Remember: we offer one complimentary resizing within 60 days, so even if you\'re not 100% certain, we\'ve got you covered!',
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this ring suitable as an investment, and will its value appreciate?',
        answer: 'Fine jewelry with GIA-certified diamonds and precious metals represents both emotional and financial value. Our rings are appraised at 30-40% above purchase price, reflecting true market value. Factors supporting long-term value: GIA certification (most recognized globally), high-quality materials (18K gold, excellent-cut diamonds), timeless design (not trendy), documented provenance, and excellent condition through our lifetime care programs. While we can\'t guarantee appreciation, quality jewelry historically maintains and often increases in value, especially with proper documentation and care.',
