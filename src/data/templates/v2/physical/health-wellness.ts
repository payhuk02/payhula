      tagline: 'Clinically-Proven Heart & Brain Support',
      shortDescription: 'Ultra-pure omega-3 fish oil delivering 2000mg EPA+DHA per serving. Third-party tested for purity, potency, and freshness. Pharmaceutical-grade with no fishy aftertaste.',
      fullDescription: `**The Gold Standard in Omega-3 Supplementation**

Your heart, brain, and overall health deserve the purest, most potent omega-3 supplement available. Our Omega-3 Triple Strength delivers pharmaceutical-grade fish oil that meets the highest purity and potency standards in the industry.

**Clinical Evidence for Heart & Brain Health**

Over 30,000 published studies support omega-3's benefits for cardiovascular health, cognitive function, and inflammation management. Our formula provides clinically-effective doses of EPA and DHA—the two most important omega-3 fatty acids.

**Key Clinical Benefits (Research-Backed):**
- Supports healthy triglyceride levels (300-500mg reduction in clinical trials)
- Promotes cardiovascular function and healthy blood pressure
- Enhances cognitive performance and memory
- Supports joint comfort and flexibility
- Helps maintain healthy inflammatory response
- Essential for eye health and visual acuity

**Pharmaceutical-Grade Purity: Third-Party Verified**

Not all fish oils are created equal. Many contain concerning levels of mercury, PCBs, and oxidation. Our omega-3 undergoes molecular distillation and rigorous purification:

✓ **Third-Party Tested**: Verified by IFOS (International Fish Oil Standards) - 5-star rating
✓ **Heavy Metal Free**: Below detection limits for mercury, lead, cadmium
✓ **Ultra-Low Oxidation**: TOTOX value <5 (industry leading)
✓ **PCB/Dioxin Free**: Tested below EU's strictest limits
✓ **Potency Verified**: Guaranteed EPA+DHA content ±10%

**Superior Triglyceride Form**

Unlike inferior ethyl ester fish oils, our omega-3 is in triglyceride form—the natural molecular structure found in fish. Research shows triglyceride-form omega-3 has:
- 70% better absorption than ethyl ester forms
- More stable and resistant to oxidation
- Better utilized by the body
- No synthetic processing required

**Premium Ingredients, Transparent Sourcing**

- **Source**: Wild-caught, sustainably harvested from cold-water anchovies, sardines, and mackerel
- **Location**: Norwegian and Icelandic waters (highest purity)
- **Processing**: Molecular distillation in GMP-certified facility
- **Sustainability**: Friend of the Sea certified, MSC approved
- **Freshness**: Nitrogen flushed, opaque bottles with mixed tocopherols (vitamin E) as natural preservative

**Optimal Dosage Backed by Research**

Each serving (2 soft gels) provides:
- **EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)**: 1200mg
- **DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid)**: 800mg
- **Total Omega-3**: 2000mg
- **Other Omega-3s**: 100mg

This dosage aligns with American Heart Association recommendations for therapeutic cardiovascular support and matches doses used in major clinical trials.

**No Fishy Burps Guarantee**

Our proprietary enteric coating technology releases omega-3 in the small intestine, not the stomach. Result? Zero fishy aftertaste or burps. Even fish-oil skeptics love our formula.

**Quality You Can Trust**

- **GMP Certified**: Manufactured in FDA-registered, GMP-compliant facility
- **NSF Certified for Sport**: Tested for banned substances (safe for athletes)
- **Non-GMO Project Verified**: Free from genetically modified ingredients
- **Gluten-Free**: Certified gluten-free by GFCO
- **Sustainably Sourced**: Friend of the Sea and MSC certified

**Complete Transparency**

Every batch is tested and assigned a lot number. Request a Certificate of Analysis (COA) for your specific bottle at any time. We publish test results because we have nothing to hide.

**The Science Team Behind the Formula**

Formulated by Dr. Sarah Mitchell, PhD in Nutritional Biochemistry, with over 20 years researching omega-3 metabolism. Reviewed and approved by our Scientific Advisory Board of cardiologists, nutritionists, and research scientists.

**What Health Professionals Say**

"This is the only fish oil I recommend to my cardiology patients. The purity testing and triglyceride form make it superior to most products on the market." — Dr. James Peterson, MD, Cardiologist ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

"As a functional medicine practitioner, I'm extremely selective about supplements. The third-party testing and sourcing transparency set this apart." — Dr. Lisa Chen, ND ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Dosage & Usage**

**Standard Dose**: 2 soft gels daily with meals
**Cardiovascular Support**: 2 soft gels twice daily (4000mg total)
**Timing**: Take with largest meal for optimal absorption
**Duration**: Continuous use recommended for sustained benefits

**Important Safety Information**

While omega-3 is generally safe, consult healthcare provider before use if:
- Taking blood thinners (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel)
- Scheduled for surgery (discontinue 2 weeks prior)
- Have seafood allergies (though molecular distillation removes allergens)
- Pregnant or nursing (generally safe, but confirm with doctor)

**Money-Back Guarantee**

Not satisfied? Return for full refund within 90 days—even if bottle is empty. We're that confident you'll feel the difference.

**Sustainable Packaging**

Opaque glass bottle protects oil from light oxidation. Nitrogen-flushed to eliminate oxygen. Recyclable materials throughout. We care about ocean health—it's where our omega-3 comes from.

Invest in your long-term health with the purest, most potent omega-3 available. Your heart and brain will thank you.`,

        question: 'Why is this omega-3 more expensive than drugstore brands?',
        answer: 'Great question! While drugstore fish oils may seem cheaper, they often contain lower doses of EPA+DHA, use inferior ethyl ester forms (70% less bioavailable), and may not undergo third-party purity testing. Our pharmaceutical-grade formula provides 2000mg of triglyceride-form omega-3 verified by IFOS 5-star testing. When you compare actual absorbed EPA+DHA per dollar—accounting for superior bioavailability—we\'re actually more cost-effective. Plus, our molecular distillation removes contaminants that cheaper brands may contain.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What does "pharmaceutical grade" actually mean?',
        answer: 'Pharmaceutical grade means our fish oil meets the highest purity and potency standards—the same standards required for prescription omega-3 medications. Specifically: (1) Molecularly distilled to remove contaminants, (2) Third-party verified for purity, potency, and freshness, (3) Contains 90%+ omega-3 concentration, (4) Heavy metals below detection limits, (5) Ultra-low oxidation (TOTOX <5). Most drugstore fish oils don\'t meet these criteria.',
      },
      {
        question: 'I\'ve heard fish oil can be contaminated. How do I know this is safe?',
        answer: 'Contamination is a valid concern—which is why we go above and beyond standard testing. Every batch is tested by independent third-party labs (IFOS, NSF, USP) for mercury, lead, cadmium, PCBs, dioxins, and over 450 environmental toxins. Our results are published, and we provide Certificates of Analysis upon request. The molecular distillation process we use is the gold standard for removing contaminants while preserving beneficial omega-3s. Bottom line: our fish oil is cleaner than the fish you eat.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How long before I see results?',
        answer: 'Timeline varies by health goal: For cardiovascular support (triglyceride reduction), clinical trials show measurable improvements within 4-6 weeks. For cognitive benefits, most research indicates 8-12 weeks of consistent use. For joint comfort, many users report improvements within 4-8 weeks. Important: omega-3 works through cellular membrane incorporation—a gradual process. Consistency is key. Think of it as an investment that compounds over months, not a quick fix.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I take this if I\'m on blood thinners?',
        answer: 'This is an important question for your physician. While omega-3 has mild blood-thinning properties, research shows it\'s generally safe with anticoagulants when used at standard doses (2-4g daily). However, individual responses vary. Please consult your cardiologist or prescribing physician before starting—they may want to monitor your INR levels if you\'re on warfarin. Many cardiologists actively recommend omega-3 for their patients on blood thinners, but personalized medical guidance is essential.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why triglyceride form instead of ethyl ester?',
        answer: 'This is where science meets practicality! Triglyceride form is how omega-3 naturally occurs in fish. It\'s the molecular structure our bodies evolved to absorb. Research shows triglyceride-form omega-3 has 70% better absorption than synthetic ethyl ester forms. It\'s also more stable (resists oxidation), better utilized at the cellular level, and closer to nature. Ethyl esters are created through chemical processing to concentrate omega-3—but our bodies have to convert them back to triglycerides anyway. Why not start with the superior form?',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need to refrigerate this?',
        answer: 'Refrigeration isn\'t required but extends freshness. Our omega-3 is nitrogen-flushed and contains vitamin E as a natural preservative, so it remains stable at room temperature when stored properly (cool, dry place, cap tightly closed). That said, refrigeration does slow oxidation—especially after opening. If you live in a warm climate or won\'t finish the bottle within 2 months, refrigeration is a good idea. Just bring to room temp before taking to avoid condensation in the bottle.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s your return policy?',
        answer: 'We offer a 90-day satisfaction guarantee—even if the bottle is empty! If you don\'t feel the benefits, simply contact us for a full refund. No need to return the product (keep it or donate it). We believe in our quality so strongly that we\'d rather risk a refund than have an unsatisfied customer. This is risk-free for you—all upside, no downside. That\'s how confident we are that you\'ll love this omega-3.',
